    </p>
    <h5>4. Contractual Obligations</h5>
    <p>
      The auction process is a method in which the Site solicits offers from buyers for the sale of lots. By submitting coins, you are making a legal offer to buy the lot. Once a bid is accepted, a contract is created between the buyer and the Site for the sale and purchase of the lot in accordance with the terms disclosed at the time of the auction. By using the Services and bidding on a lot, or by using the 'Buy It Now' function, you agree to complete the transaction as described and fulfill any and all contractual obligations.
    </p>
    <h5>5. Access to Systems</h5>
    <p>
      You are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the Services, including, without limitation: (i) accessing data not intended for such user or logging onto a server or an account which the user is not authorized to access; (ii) attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization; or (iii) accessing or using the Services or any portion thereof without authorization, in violation of these Terms or in violation of applicable law.

    </p>
    <h5>6. Bidding</h5>
    <p>
      Each BidBuzz bid (a "Bid") is a limited, non-transferable, one-year license to place one bid on a BidBuzz auction. coins have no monetary value; are not credited against the purchase price of products purchased on the Site; and may not be exchanged for money or any items of monetary value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the billing of charges, BidBuzz would like to advise all users to monitor their bidding practices. Repeated online bidding can incur high costs. Users should therefore pay attention to their bidding practices.
    </p>

Fraudulent bidders may be reported to relevant state and federal law enforcement agencies and BidBuzz will cooperate to ensure that violators are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Additionally, the user may be required to compensate BidBuzz for any damages.
    </p>
    <p>

      Each user acknowledges that BidBuzz's network may only be used for lawful purposes. BidBuzz reserves the right to monitor all network activity. While using BidBuzz, each user agrees to refrain from the following prohibited acts:
      <ul>
        <li>Maintaining more than one account or maintaining control or influence over more than one account;</li>
        <li>Infringing upon the intellectual property of BidBuzz, establishing a competing site, or otherwise copying or using the data on the Site for any reason other than bidding on products for the bidder's own use;</li>
        <li>Manipulate the bidding process by placing fictitious coins, colluding with other parties to create the illusion of volume ('marking the close' or 'painting the tape'), or engaging in any other disingenuous or fraudulent activity that undermines the integrity of the online market;</li>
        <li>Breaching BidBuzz's policies;</li>

    </p>
    <h5>8. Collusion/Team Play</h5>
    <p>
      Any kind of collusion or team play is strictly forbidden on BidBuzz. By definition, this includes, but is not limited to, two or more members working together as a team, or creating the impression that there are more people involved and competing to win an auction than there actually are, or placing coins until Buy it Now offers are earned and then switching over to another account to continue to earn further Buy it Now offers on the same deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      BidBuzz does not allow two members that know, or are associated with, each other to participate in the same auction. Two members participating in the auction are by definition engaging in team play, and automatically lose their right to purchase the Deal or receive any of their spent coins back.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to disqualify, in our absolute discretion, any users we suspect to be working in a team by voiding all their wins and freezing their accounts. No funds or coins will be returned or transferred into other accounts. If a user is found to have violated these Terms, any free coins provided to them and used, including those provided in the past, must immediately be paid for by user at their current selling price.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h5>10. Investigation of Violations</h5>
    <p>
      We may investigate any violation of these Terms, our policies or guidelines, or any other complaints and take any action that we deem appropriate and reasonable under the circumstance to protect our systems, facilities, users and/or third parties. Our actions may include, but are not limited to, issuing warnings, suspension or termination of the Services or any user accounts, and/or removal of or disabling access to content hosted on BidBuzz's systems. We reserve the right and have absolute discretion to remove or disable access, screen, or edit any content that violates these provisions or is otherwise objectionable.

However, BidBuzz cannot review all Licensed Materials before it is posted on its Services, and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted.

BidBuzz has no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or non-performance of the activities described in this Section.
    </p>
    <h5>13. Registration with BidBuzz for Use</h5>
    <p>
      To use the Services, you must first register for an online user account, consisting of a username, password, credit card information, billing address, and other information as may be required by BidBuzz. You may register only once and may only have one account at BidBuzz for your personal use. Additionally, each household or "group of users associated with each other", determined by the sole discretion of BidBuzz, may not register or have control over more than two BidBuzz member accounts. If a single person is found to have or maintain control over several accounts on BidBuzz, or if a household or a "group of users associated with each other" is found to have or maintain control over more than two accounts on BidBuzz, all accounts will be immediately suspended, all auctions the accounts have participated in will be voided, and any coins purchased will be removed without prior warning and without any form of compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the registration process, the user must choose a username. The username may not offend common decency or infringe upon the rights of third parties. The username may also not be misleading in any way or, in BidBuzz's judgment, closely resemble the identity of an existing user. It is a condition of your use of the Services that all the information you provide through the Services is correct, current, and complete. You agree to maintain and promptly update your user account information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or BidBuzz has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, BidBuzz may suspend or terminate your account or access to the Services. If you abuse your user account, whether it harms a third party or BidBuzz, you may be disqualified and, if applicable, BidBuzz may notify applicable authorities of the possibility of a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      ACCOUNTS AUTHORIZED TO USE THE SERVICES CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED OR USED BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE AUTHORIZED ACCOUNT HOLDER. USE OF THIS ACCOUNT BY A PERSON OR PERSONS NOT AUTHORIZED BY BIDBUZZ IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED. NO MORE THAN ONE LOG-IN SESSION OR ONE AUTHORIZED ACCOUNT USER CAN BE ACTIVE AT A TIME FOR ANY ACCOUNT. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY THE bid buzzer SYSTEM, ACCOUNTS WHICH HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED IN WHOLE, PART, OR PROXY BIDDING TO OTHER PARTIES, OR SHOW OTHER ACTIVITY IN VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS, ARE SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE TERMINATION. BIDBUZZ RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN LOGS OF ACCOUNT ACTIVITY AND TO USE SAID LOGS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETECTING USAGE IN VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS.
    </p>
    <p>
      BidBuzz reserves the right to at any time temporarily or permanently disqualify a user for violating these Terms. Users will be disqualified when, in BidBuzz's reasonable opinion, a user has violated any law, regulation or equitable interest in favor of a third party, such as protecting users and the Service from manipulation. Examples of the foregoing include, but are not limited to, (i) honoring coins of users who have not paid for the coins, (ii) the use of unauthorized bidding software, or (iii) establishing several user accounts for the same person. Moreover, BidBuzz reserves the right to cancel unauthorized BidBuzz accounts or accounts that have been inactive. Each user agrees not to hold BidBuzz responsible for any loss incurred as a result of such action.
    </p>
    <h5>14. Bid Purchasing for Online Bidding / Payment</h5>
    <p>
      All prices are quoted and payments processed in Indian rupees. The user is responsible for conversion rates and fees which may occur in case of a currency conversion done by their bank or payment processor.
    </p>
    <p>
      BidBuzz Coins must be purchased by users prior to online bidding. Only registered users can submit the online coins, which can be purchased in packages (so-called 'Coin Packs') at the currently applicable prices, which can be viewed in 'Coins' section available on the navigation pane. The Coins must be paid for in advance. When the Coins are purchased and deposited into the user's BidBuzz account, a contract for the purchase of the Coins materializes. The associated invoice is due immediately. If a user is suspended for whatever reason, all of their Coins will be forfeited and will not be refunded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users who have won an auction and paid for a product are not eligible for a refund on either Coin purchases, account activation fees, or product fees if their product has been shipped by the time of request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should a payment not be honored for a user, a returned payment fee will be charged. The user shall be solely responsible for these fees. BidBuzz reserves the right to block access to the user account until full payment is received by BidBuzz for the outstanding amount, including any fees due to returned payment, etc. BidBuzz may withhold any outstanding deliveries until it receives full payment. The user's bank may or may not charge the user an international payment fee in connection with a credit card payment on the BidBuzz site. It is the sole responsibility of the user to be familiar with the policies and practices of his or her bank for such fees. BidBuzz holds no responsibility for additional payment fees of any kind issued to the user by the user's bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      BidBuzz reserves the right to sell Coins at any discounted price to specific user groups for promotional purposes. All BidBuzz users understand that they may from time to time receive unique offers to buy discounted Coins and that other users may do so as well. Similarly, users may see different product pricing, based partly on the activity characteristics of that user. BidBuzz may issue any number of free coins to users or user groups as part of special promotions or for any other reasons at its discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      BidBuzz reserves the right to, at its discretion, remove any sign up or other promotional Coins that have been added to a user's account for free at any given time without further notice.
    </p>
    <h5>15. Bidding / BidBuzzer</h5>
    <p>
      For online bidding, an individual bid can be submitted by clicking the "BID NOW" button, or by using the automated bidding tool called the 'bid buzzer'. After the first Bid Pack purchase used coins are no longer valid for refunds and it is deducted from the user's Coins balance accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bid buzzer can assist bidders in being able to bid in an auction, even if the bidders are not online at that time. Only registered users can submit coins automatically with one or more BidBuzzers. The bid buzzer automatically submits coins according to the specifications set in advance by the user. The user can read about how the bid buzzer operates in the 'FAQ' section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Booking a bid buzzer before an auction starts does not guarantee participation in the auction. Particularly in popular auctions BidBuddies by some users may not have a possibility to place a bid before the No Jumper limit is reached. In these cases all coins booked into the bid buzzer are returned automatically to the user. To secure a spot in an auction, BidBuzz advises to book the bid buzzer or place one manual bid after the auction has started and before it has reached the No Jumper limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      BidBuzz does not guarantee the precision of the bid buzzer feature and BidBuzz may not be held responsible for any bid buzzer software errors of commission or omission. The user is prohibited from using any bidding software not authorized by BidBuzz; if the user does, in fact, use unauthorized software, it may result in immediate disqualification from BidBuzz's systems and Service. BidBuzz will from time to time award all users who start using the Site with free coins. The number of free coins awarded or not awarded is determined solely by BidBuzz on an account by account basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bid is registered and counted only when BidBuzz's system registers the bid. A bid is not counted and valid when it is sent from the user's Web browser, but when BidBuzz's servers receive and register the bid request.
    </p>
    <p>
      It usually takes less than a second for a bid to be registered, however it may take up to several seconds or longer for BidBuzz to receive the bid if there is a delay in the network or if the system is under high stress. BidBuzz is not responsible for any delays that occur in bidding or in the auctions. BidBuzz strives to make the BidBuzz timer clocks as accurate as possible. While BidBuzz believes that auction timers are very accurate, BidBuzz cannot and does not guarantee that the system, including the bidding clock, will always function reliably.
    </p>
    <p>
      All coins are final. Winning coins and their associated fees are non-refundable.
    </p>
    <p>
      To comply with fair and honest auction practices, BidBuzz will reschedule auctions that end prematurely due to severe third party or technical problems to a later time. In such events, where all bidders aren't able to participate normally in the auctions, BidBuzz will return all used coins from such rescheduled auctions to all involved bidders.
    </p>
    <h5>16. Bid Expiration</h5>
    <p>
      coins held in user accounts must be used within 365 days from the day that the coins have entered the account through purchase, item exchange or auction win. If the coins have not been used within that time, they will expire and be permanently removed from the account.
    </p>
    <h5>17. How the Auctions Work</h5>
    <p>
      With each bid submitted, the price of the item on which the user is bidding increases by $0.01. A bid submitted by the user constitutes an offer from that user to BidBuzz to conclude a contract to purchase the item. A contract to purchase the item does not materialize until the auction is finished and the last bidder has followed all the steps provided for in this Section. The purchase contract will exist between BidBuzz and the user who has submitted the highest bid up until the point when the last bidder has submitted the last qualifying bid of the respective auction.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each new bid resets the 'countdown time' for the auction. The countdown time for each of the auctions is shown on the auction details. The auction ends when no more coins are submitted within the remaining time stated. However, an auction may not end if anyone else except the highest bidder still has coins booked on their bid buzzer. In the event of heavy network lag, the bid buzzer may place the bid with a slight delay with the system registering the bid 1+ seconds after the auction's countdown time. Such bid will be completely valid, provided that the bidder had booked his bid buzzer within the auction's countdown time.</p>
    <p>
      The user who submits the highest bid and is the last to bid wins the auction. All other coins on the item expire and will not be refunded. The last bidder is determined based on the records in BidBuzz's database and BidBuzz's decision regarding the identity of the last bidder shall be final. If a bid is placed too late, does not reset the timer of an auction or is not correctly registered by the system, it is then invalid. Even though this bid may be the last bid on an auction, it is the last and highest valid bid on an auction that wins the auction.
    </p>
    <p>
    An invalid bid is one where the auction timer is not reset after the bid has been placed. BidBuzz recommends its users to always bid at least 5 seconds prior to the auction timer reaches zero, as otherwise the bid might be reflected as accepted by the system, but in reality be received too late.</p>
    <p>
    Auctions may offer the 'Buy It Now & Get your coins Back' option ("Buy it Now"). 'Buy It Now' will allow you to receive your spent coins back, if you purchase the same model of an identical item at its 'Buy it Now' price. The option to 'Buy It Now' will be offered for a limited period of time (usually 7 days after the auction ends) after which the option to 'Buy It Now' is permanently revoked.</p>
    <p>The 'Buy it Now & Get your coins Back' option is offered at the 'Buy it Now & Get your coins Back' price listed for each auction. The price may vary between auctions for the same product, but will not change not after the first bid has been placed in an auction. The price is provided solely for the purpose of exercising the 'Buy it Now & Get your coins Back' option. For the avoidance of doubt, BidBuzz can not guarantee that the 'Buy it Now & Get your coins Back' prices are comparable to prices for which the item is sold through retailers or other merchants elsewhere, and thus the 'Buy it Now & Get your coins Back' pricing should not be seen as a reflection of product value, or used for price comparisons or other similar purposes.</p>
    <p>BidBuzz is not responsible for third party abuse and manipulation of the BidBuzz service, for example, if other users create chaos on the Site that then results in lost coins. In that case, and other cases of third party abuse, BidBuzz is not responsible.</p>
    <p>BidBuzz is constantly attempting to maintain fairness and balance in its auctions therefore some new users or users who have lost auctions may receive special promotions, access to special auctions, and/or free coins through site features. This is designed to maintain fair practice and helps balance and create a great auction experience for all users.</p>
    <h5>18. Notification of the Win / Acceptance of the Win / Payment</h5>
    <p>After the auction has ended, the highest bidder ('winner') who is logged on with BidBuzz will see a 'congratulation page' displayed, along with all of the important information such as the total price, the payment details, etc. The user must actively confirm the win by following the steps indicated on that page or elsewhere on the Services. As soon as the winner has paid the total amount reflected on the 'payment page', the win is accepted. The winner will also receive a notification of the win by e-mail with a request for payment.</p>
    <p>The user must pay the total price (auction price and applicable taxes) no later than 14 days after the notification of the win is sent. After this deadline has passed, BidBuzz can declare a rescission of the purchase contract to the user, which results in revocation of the user's right to delivery of the item. There is likewise no entitlement to replacement of any of the coins used in the auction. If a user chooses to "Buy it Now", the item price including applicable tax fees must be paid within 7 days of the auction ending in order to be eligible. Users are responsible for all applicable tax charges associated with purchases.</p>
    <p>Orders may be subject to sales tax (when applicable and required by law). Buy it Now orders the tax is based on the Buy it Now price and for auction wins the tax is based on the final auction price.</p>
    <p>The user may obtain and be legally entitled to the product only after the user fully pays for the product and all of the applicable coins used to obtain the product. Should the user not pay for coins that have already been purchased, payments received shall be viewed as payment toward the coins not yet paid for, and a right of retention shall be exercised with regard to the item purchased at auction until all coins and the total price have been paid in full. If the user chooses to pay for the item by credit card and the sales price is lower than $1, then the price may be rounded up to $1.</p>
    <p>BidBuzz may offer the option to exchange the auction win to coins. If available, the offer is presented before making a payment for the auction win. If the user accepts the exchange to coins offer the coins are added to the user's account, and the user loses the option to pay the auction price (plus applicable taxes) to obtain the item. The offer may change over time and vary between users and auctions.</p>
    <p>If the user does not receive the won product or product obtained through "Buy it Now", the user must file in a claim of non-receipt via e-mail to support@bidbuzz.in within sixty (60) calendar days of the purchase, or BidBuzz's obligation to deliver the product will end. No refunds of the purchase amount or cost of spent coins to win the item will be returned to the user.</p>
    <p>BidBuzz is not responsible for stolen or lost items. In the event that a product is stolen or lost, BidBuzz will do its best to help customers upon request, by providing tracking information received from the supplier, as well as screenshots or copies of the sales receipt and possible shipping confirmation, if available.</p>
    <h5>19. Cancellation / Rescission</h5>
    <p>
      The user may return the item in an un-depreciated condition within 30 days of receipt if not satisfied for any reason. Upon verification of the product's condition, BidBuzz will refund the purchase price of the product. BidBuzz will not refund the value of the coins spent to obtain the product. In the event that a user wishes to return a Buy it Now order the user also forfeits all the Free coins given to them alongside the purchase. If the user has used the Free coins given to them, the user will need to purchase the equivalent number of coins in order for BidBuzz to process the refund. Once both the item has been returned and the Free coins removed from the user's account, a refund will be given. Only coins that have been acquired by purchasing Bid Packs for the then-current full price shall have a right for refund within 30 calendar days of purchase (90 calendar days for first Bid pack purchase). Such paid coins are always used first, before promotional coins, free coins, coins obtained through the Buy it Now or other coins that have been obtained in any other way than paying full price for each Bid. coins obtained during the Buy it Now process do not have any rights to refund. BidBuzz also grants to the user ordering products for personal purposes the right to cancel in accordance with statutory provisions on mail order sales and e-commerce. The right to cancel does not exist in the case of mail order sales and e-commerce contracts for the delivery of audio and video recordings or of software, if and to the extent that the seal on the delivered media has been broken by the user.
    </p>
    <h5>20. Delivery</h5>
    <p>Unless otherwise agreed, delivery will be made from BidBuzz's supplier's warehouse or from BidBuzz's warehouse to the address provided by the user. Deliveries are made solely within the India and the states and mainland territories of Australia. BidBuzz may engage third parties to satisfy its contractual obligations without being required to notify the buyer. Obvious damage to the item from transport or packaging damaged during transport is to be reported to the supplier upon taking delivery.</p>
    <p>Should BidBuzz not be able to deliver the item ordered for whichever reason, BidBuzz is entitled to declare rescission to the user or to substitute the item with a comparable replacement product with similar features. BidBuzz may also choose to replace the item ordered with a gift card of the value of the item that the user may choose to use to obtain the same product. This also applies for items ordered through Buy it Now from the BidBuzz store.</p>
    <p>If the product delivered is damaged, defective, or otherwise does not match the product description, BidBuzz will replace the product at BidBuzz's expense. Please contact support@bidbuzz.in to arrange return and replacement of any such product. Replacement is not covered for any items shipped to a freight forwarding company and shipment to a freight forwarding company is not permitted under these Terms.</p>
    <h5>21. Right of Substitution</h5>
    <p>
      Subject to the cancellation policy specified herein, BidBuzz may substitute another similar item of the same general character or function, provided it has the same or higher retail value, for purposes of delivery to the user. BidBuzz may substitute another similar item of a lesser value if the user requests one, or furnish the user with a gift card. A gift card may be the most suitable substitute solution for challenges related to product availability or supplier challenges. Such right of substitution may be necessary from time to time if, for example, unforeseen or undetected challenges arise with the manufacturing or inventory system of the supplier, impacting the ability to deliver the exact item sought by the user.
    </p>
    <h5>22. Product Correction</h5>
    <p>If BidBuzz is unable to provide the user with the item auctioned due to unforeseen circumstances, BidBuzz reserves the right to offer the winner in its absolute discretion an alternative item in the same price range or the equivalent of the item's Manufacturer's Recommended Retail Price ('MSRP') in coins so that if a Bid's then-current price is $0.60, BidBuzz issuing one (1) Bid to the user is equal to $0.60.</p>
    <p>Should subsequent correction be undertaken by way of delivery of the item originally auctioned, the user shall be obligated to return to BidBuzz the substituted item delivered within 30 days at BidBuzz's expense.</p>
    <p>Items delivered shall remain BidBuzz's property until payment in full of the total price, including for the coins used in the auction. Until such time as full payment has been made, the user undertakes to store the item separately from their other possessions and to insure it. BidBuzz shall have full rights of access to the place where the item is located during normal business hours to take possession of it.</p>
